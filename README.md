Python Packaging Example

This repository contains a simple Python project demonstrating how to package Python code and write tests using the unittest module.
Project Structure

    calculator.py: Main script for the calculator application.
    calculations/: Directory containing modules for arithmetic operations.
        addition.py: Module for addition operation.
        subtraction.py: Module for subtraction operation.
        multiplication.py: Module for multiplication operation.
        division.py: Module for division operation.
    test_calculator.py: Test script for testing the calculator functions.

Usage

To run the calculator application, execute the calculator.py script:


python calculator.py

To run the tests for the calculator functions, execute the test_calculator.py script:


python test_calculator.py

Packaging

This project demonstrates how to package Python code into modules and organize them into directories. Each module contains a class for a specific arithmetic operation.
Testing

The calculator functions are tested using the unittest module. Test cases are written to ensure that each arithmetic operation produces the correct result.
